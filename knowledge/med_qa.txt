Radioactive iodine therapy and thyroidectomy are contraindicated in pregnancy.

1	Exposure to parasitic infection is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms.

0.9	The girl most likely has Tetralogy of Fallot.

0.8	The most likely cause of the 79-year-old woman's current condition is delirium.

0.9	A 24-year-old man with a stab wound to the left chest below the clavicle presents with rapid, shallow breathing, anxiety, tachycardia, hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. These findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade.

0.8	A renal biopsy is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition.

0.9	The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is pulmonary embolism.

0.8	The lack of lasting immunity in this case could be due to the presence of antigenic variation in the causative organism, which is likely Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Bell's palsy, which is characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy is often caused by inflammation or compression of the facial nerve. In this case, the patient's sickle cell disease may have contributed to the development of Bell's palsy. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as analgesics for pain management and eye protection to prevent corneal abrasions. Most cases of Bell's palsy resolve spontaneously within 3-6 months.

0.8	A throat swab for culture is most likely to confirm the diagnosis.

0.9	A bone marrow biopsy should be performed next.

0.8	The patient is likely to be infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adulthood.

0.9	The best next step in management would be to reassure the mother that her milk production is likely adequate and that the regurgitation is likely due to gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The patient's symptoms, including regurgitation of breastmilk, mild upset during episodes of regurgitation, and quick resolution of symptoms, are consistent with GER. The fact that the patient's height and weight percentiles have remained stable suggests that he is still growing adequately. Additionally, the absence of other concerning symptoms such as diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies further supports the diagnosis of GER. Reassurance and conservative management, such as feeding smaller volumes more frequently and keeping the patient upright after feeds, are usually sufficient for managing GER in infants. If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation and management may be necessary.

0.9	Conjunctival pallor is a feature of this patient's anemia.

0.9	Based on the symptoms and history provided, it is recommended to adjust the current asthma treatment regimen for the six-year-old boy. The increase in albuterol inhaler use and nighttime awakenings indicate poor asthma control. The presence of wheezes on lung auscultation further supports the need for treatment modification. The specific changes to the treatment regimen should be determined by a healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or pulmonologist, who can assess the severity of the asthma and consider factors such as the frequency of symptoms, lung function tests, and the child's response to previous treatments. Possible adjustments may include adding a daily controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, to reduce airway inflammation and prevent symptoms, or increasing the dose or frequency of the current medication. It is important for the boy's mother to consult with a healthcare professional for an individualized treatment plan.

0.8	The symptoms described in the case can be explained by hyperthyroidism and the complex structure in the right ovary may be indicative of an ovarian cyst or tumor.

0.8	In a 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism, antibodies are most likely targeting the gastric parietal cells.

0.9	The patient's serum and urine osmolality can be explained by diabetes insipidus, specifically nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This condition is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in excessive urine production and dilute urine. The high serum osmolality indicates dehydration due to the loss of water through urine, while the low urine osmolality suggests the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine.

0.9	The most likely cause of this patient's condition is celiac disease.

0.9	The most appropriate next step in management for a 64-year-old man with lower back pain, fever, chills, and a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, amputation, and smoking would be to start empiric antibiotic therapy.

The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and ultrasound results suggest a possible ovarian torsion, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists on its vascular pedicle, leading to compromised blood flow and subsequent ischemia. It typically presents with sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The presence of a left adnexal mass, tenderness, and free fluid on ultrasound further support this diagnosis. Given the negative urinary pregnancy test, other causes of acute abdominal pain, such as ectopic pregnancy, can be ruled out. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent ovarian necrosis and preserve fertility.
